# avengers-careers
Webpage for recruiting potential Avengers.
Inspiration for this webpage was a freeCodeCamp assignment where we had to create a form. I ended up creating an application form for the Avengers.
For this project I added a webpage to go along with the application to entice potential recruits to apply. For inpsiration, I looked at the careers webpages of Nintendo, Google & Microsoft.
Though the original assignment was meant to be done in plain CSS, I wanted to practice using Bootstrap 5. So much of this webpage is arranged and styled with it.
Also the pictures aren't all of the same level of quality. But as far as practicing with Bootstrap goes, spending lots of time looking for better images online isn't the best use of my time.
